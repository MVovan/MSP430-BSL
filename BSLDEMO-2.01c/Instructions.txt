This version of BSLDEMO2 is intended for use with generic USB-to-UART
adapters such as the FT232, CP2102 and CH340.  In the official TI
BSLDEMO2, the polarity of the DTR line is wrong when used with such
adapters.  In addition, the polarity of RTS is wrong if the target
MSP430 device has dedicated JTAG pins (i.e. - if it has a TCK pin
instead of a TEST pin).

This modified BSLDEMO has two added options for the command line:

-i   Invert the polarity of DTR.  Always include when using adapters.

-j   Invert the polarity of RTS.  Include if RTS connects to TCK.

If you type BSLDEMO-2.01C.exe -h on the command line, these new options
will appear in the help screen list.

Information on the BSL hardware invocation sequences on /Reset and TEST
(or TCK) is included in TI's SLAU319.pdf.
